Oh and then buff Shadowborn to make up for its benefit now being effectively worse, since +15 is a much more significant (relative) increase to 87 than it is to 100."
"Skeleton_Hotel","man dbd really should increase the default fov for killer huh.

I've personally grown comfortable with it but it's wild that a non-trivial number of people are made motion sick by it, to the point where they can't play killer, and BHVR is just like ""*shrug* equip Shadowborn lol."""
"Skeleton_Hotel","every time this comes up someone says ""but the low FOV is part of what balances killer."" And sure technically a baseline FOV increase would be a ""buff"" to killer in general. But if it were really THAT powerful... Shadowborn would be a meta perk."
